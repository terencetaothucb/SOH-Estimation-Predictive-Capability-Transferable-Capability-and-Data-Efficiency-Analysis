# SOH-Estimation-Predictive-Capability-Transferable-Capability-and-Data-Efficiency-Analysis

This repository contains the datasets, processed features, results, and code used for **State-of-Health (SOH) prediction of lithium-ion batteries** with a focus on **Predictive Capability Transferable Capability and data sufficiency**.  
The work involves two datasets (CALCE and TJU), extracted degradation-related features, and XGBoost-based predictive modeling.

The repository structure is as follows:

---

### 1. Raw Datasets
- **CALCE dataset (University of Maryland, Centre for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering)**  
  - Batteries **CS_35** (source domain, discharged at 1C)  
  - Batteries **CS_33** (target domain, discharged at 0.5C)  
  - Charging protocol: CC at 0.5C until 4.2 V → CV at 4.2 V until current < 0.05 A  
  - Discharge protocol: CC to 2.7 V  

- **TJU dataset (Tongji University)**  
  - 18650-type NCA batteries tested at **25 °C, 35 °C, and 45 °C**  
  - **Source domain:** 19 batteries at 25 °C (charged 0.5C, discharged 1C)  
  - **Target domain:** 3 batteries at 35 °C (charged 0.5C, discharged 1C); the longest-life battery is used as target in our work
